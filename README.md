<p>This GitHub public repository ( <b><a href="https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-ocas">https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-ocas</a></b> ) was created at the request of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/">OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC</a> as an <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/">OASIS TC Open Repository</a> to support development of open source resources related to Technical Committee work.</p>

<p>While this TC Open Repository remains associated with the sponsor TC, its development priorities, leadership, intellectual property terms, participation rules, and other matters of governance are <a href="https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-ocas/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#governance-distinct-from-oasis-tc-process">separate and distinct</a> from the OASIS TC Process and related policies.</p>

<h2><a id="purposeStatement">Statement of Purpose</a></h2>

<p>Statement of Purpose for this OASIS TC Open Repository (openc2-ocas) as <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-FunCZrr-vtSElMM0RieFd5alk">proposed</a> and <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ballot.php?id=3115">approved</a> [<a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/TCADMIN-2744">bis</a>] by the OpenC2 TC:</p>

<p>The purpose of the OASIS openc2-ocas GitHub repository is to (a) demonstrate how OpenC2 can be developed as an Erlang/OTP application [ http://www.erlang.org ]; (b) maintain a library of prototype implementations; (c) establish a codebase to enable other prototype efforts.</p>

<p>Ocas is a viable simulator for testing OpenC2 code, scenarios and use cases and may be used as a template for developing actual OpenC2 applications (i.e. augment the simulator code to actually perform the security functionality commanded).  Erlang is  especially suited for concurrent and parallel computing needed for security applications in cloud deployments. Erlang has been used by industry for applications that provide nine 9's or greater of reliability. Erlang scales particularly well for complex network simulations because concurrency and message passing are a fundamental of the language.</p>

<p>The initial codebase is imported from the OpenC2 Forum's Github repository, maintained by Duncan Sparrell.</p>
